"""
Saccade Duration Analysis for Zebrafish Data.

This script was used for the 2023 Penguin Manuscript to analyze the saccade durations from our zebrafish data.
It uses the SaccadeAnalysis class to detect saccades, extract data in a window around each saccade,
and perform further analysis on these windows.
