# DALLAS - Dlc seperAte muLti animaL AnalysiS

## Divide and conquer to analyse the trajectory file

1. read in data frame wise
1.1. read in text file row wise
1.2. get frame frameNumber
1.3. read in object data
        - object:
            - name
            - qualitÃ¤t
            - bounding box
            - center of mass
2. identify arena 
2.1 which arena-object is where on the image (marker?)
    - sorting after x and y coordinates
    - finding marker position 
    - identifying which arena is where
2.2 mean of arenas over time to stabilize arena positions
3. fly analysis
    - fly assignment to arena
    - fly trajectory
4. food choice preference
    - if the mean x coordinate of the fly is larger than the mean x coordinate of the assigned arena, the fly is on the right position
    - preference IDX
    - choice frequency
    - activity from trajectory

x0: X-coordinate of the upper left corner of the bounding box normalised to image width
y0: Y-coordinate of the upper left corner of the bounding box normalised to image height
x0: X-coordinate of the lower right corner of the bounding box
y0: Y-coordinate of the lower right of the bounding box
